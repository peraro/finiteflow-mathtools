Integrable Symbols
==================

Two examples computing a complete list of integrable symbols from the
planar two-loop five-point alphabet in a massless theory.  They use
some functions from the Symbols package in this repository.

It contains two files, with two independent examples:
- [2L5P_mom_twistors.wl](2L5P_mom_twistors.wl) uses a rational
  parametrization of the alphabet
- [2L5P_mandelstam.wl](2L5P_mandelstam.wl) uses Mandelstam invariants
  and computes the integrable symbols without rationalizing the square
  root present in the alphabet

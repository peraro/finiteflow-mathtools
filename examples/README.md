FiniteFlow examples
===================

A collection of examples using the Mathematica interface to
FiniteFlow, and the other [packages](../packages/README.md) in this
repository.  They are split in the following subdirectories:

- [scattering_amplitudes](scattering_amplitudes/README.md) contains
  examples of the calculation of scattering amplitudes
- [differential_equations](differential_equations/README.md) contains
  examples of the calculation of differential equations for loop
  master integrals
- [integrable_symbols](integrable_symbols/README.md) contains examples
  building integrable symbols from a known alphabet
- [reconstruction_jobs](reconstruction_jobs/README.md) contains an
  example of multivariate reconstruction where the evaluations are
  split into several jobs which may be run either sequentially or in
  parallel on several nodes or machines

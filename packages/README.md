FiniteFlow MathTools packages
=============================

A collection of Mathematica packages using the finiteflow library:

- **FFUtils**: utilities implementing simple general purpose
  algorithms, such as algorithms for finding linear relations between
  functions.
- **LiteMomentum**: utilities for momenta in QFT.  It does not use
  FiniteFlow, but it is used by other packages and examples in this
  repository.
- **LiteIBP**: utilities and tools for generating IBP systems of
  equations, with the help of LiteRed.
- **Symbols**: contains Mathematica scripts for builduing integrable
  symbols from known alphabets.
